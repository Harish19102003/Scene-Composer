# Image-to-Scene Narration Model - Project Summary

## Overview
I have successfully built a complete image-to-scene narration model from scratch without using any pretrained models. The model takes images as input and generates detailed scene descriptions in natural language.

## What Was Built

### 1. Custom Model Architecture (`model.py`)
- **ImageEncoder**: Custom CNN with residual blocks (similar to ResNet but built from scratch)
  - 4 residual layers with increasing channels (64→128→256→512)
  - Global average pooling and linear projection
  - No pretrained weights used
- **TextDecoder**: LSTM-based decoder with attention mechanism
  - Attention weights between decoder hidden state and image features
  - Gating mechanism for better attention control
  - Embedding layer for word representations
- **ImageToSceneModel**: Complete model combining encoder and decoder

### 2. Data Pipeline (`dataset.py`)
- **StanfordImageCaptionDataset**: Custom dataset class for the Stanford dataset
- **Vocabulary**: Text preprocessing and vocabulary management
- **Data Loaders**: Efficient batching with variable-length sequence handling
- **Text Cleaning**: Normalization and preprocessing of paragraph descriptions

### 3. Training Infrastructure (`train.py`)
- **Complete Training Loop**: Forward/backward passes with gradient clipping
- **Custom Loss Function**: Handles variable-length sequences properly
- **Optimization**: Adam optimizer with learning rate scheduling
- **Checkpointing**: Save/load model states and resume training
- **TensorBoard Logging**: Monitor training progress

### 4. Evaluation System (`evaluate.py`)
- **BLEU Score Calculation**: Measures n-gram overlap with reference captions
- **Attention Visualization**: Shows what parts of images the model focuses on
- **Comprehensive Metrics**: Vocabulary coverage, caption length analysis
- **Batch Evaluation**: Efficient evaluation on test sets

### 5. Inference System (`inference.py`)
- **SceneNarrator Class**: Easy-to-use interface for generating narrations
- **Batch Processing**: Handle multiple images efficiently
- **Temperature Control**: Adjust randomness in text generation
- **Error Handling**: Robust image loading and processing

### 6. Utility Functions (`utils.py`)
- **Training Utilities**: Gradient clipping, checkpoint management
- **Evaluation Metrics**: BLEU scores, attention analysis
- **Model Analysis**: Parameter counting, model size calculation
- **Early Stopping**: Prevent overfitting

### 7. Interactive Web App (`app.py`)
- **Gradio Interface**: User-friendly web interface
- **Real-time Generation**: Upload images and get instant narrations
- **Attention Visualization**: See what the model focuses on
- **Parameter Control**: Adjust generation settings
- **History Tracking**: Keep track of previous generations
- **Export Features**: Save results and history

## Dataset Used
- **Stanford Image Paragraph Captioning Dataset**
- **19,551 images** with detailed paragraph descriptions
- **Train/Val/Test Split**: 14,579 / 2,490 / 2,492 samples
- **Vocabulary Size**: ~9,870 words (after filtering)
